# Abstract:

All venue bookings, hotels bookings and all other records were manual. They were facing lot of problem in this manual system. I have suggested to the management to convert their system into computerized web based system which fulfill your all requirements.

We have also added the many advance features which not exist in the computerized systems and we also enhance the existing features. It includes Venues, hotels meeting room’s etc. bookings into the system. My software has the facility to give a unique id for every user automatically. It is accessible either by venue booker, venue owner. The data can be retrieved easily.  The interface is very user-friendly. There are a number of Venue Booking features.

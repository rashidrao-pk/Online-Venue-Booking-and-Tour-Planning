# Abstract:

All venue bookings, hotels bookings and all other records were manual. They were facing lot of problem in this manual system. I have suggested to the management to convert their system into computerized web based system which fulfill your all requirements.
My project OVBTP (Online Venue Booking and Tour Planner) is to convert the manual based system to totally computerize and automatic system. We have also added the many advance features which not exist in the computerized systems and we also enhance the existing features. It includes Venues, hotels meeting room’s etc. bookings into the system. My software has the facility to give a unique id for every user automatically. It is accessible either by venue booker, venue owner. The data can be retrieved easily.  The interface is very user-friendly. There are a number of Venue Booking features. Some common features available in all systems like User’s Registration, Post Venue’s Edit and Update Venues. I tried to develop OVBTP (Online Venue Booking and Tour Planner) that all the sections are totally interconnected to each other. My main objective is that this OVBTP (Online Venue Booking and Tour Planner) must be able to manage their all the venue bookings through online system with less time consuming
